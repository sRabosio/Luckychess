# Luckychess

Luckychess is a two player variation of a common chess game.
To begin with, the starting player draws from a standard 52 cards deck. The resulting number will be the times he's got to move a piece he selects. 

For example: Player 1 draws a 3 of spades. It decides to move the knight from a certain starting position (image related) The player HAS to move exactly 3 times with the knight so he may reach certain positions
             or can move back and forth to mantain a certain one.
